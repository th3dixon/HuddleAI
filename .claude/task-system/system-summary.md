## 🎯 Next Steps

The CMS task system is fully initialized and ready for execution. The first batch of 4 parallel tasks can begin immediately, with clear acceptance criteria and file deliverables.

**Recommended approach:**
1. Execute the current queue of 4 tasks in parallel
2. Validate builds and mark tasks complete
3. Continue with the next batch of 8 tasks that will be unlocked
4. Maintain steady progress through PHASE-1 foundation work

This systematic approach ensures high-quality deliverables, manageable development cycles, and successful completion of the Provider CMS system specification.
