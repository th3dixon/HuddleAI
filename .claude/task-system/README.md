# Me and My Dog - Task Management System

## Overview

This task management system breaks down the remaining 25% of work needed to complete the Me and My Dog MVP platform. The system is designed to enable efficient parallel execution while maintaining proper dependencies.

## Quick Start

```bash
# Check current status
claude-code run .claude/commands/queue-status.md

# Get next task
claude-code run .claude/commands/next-task.md

# Complete a task
claude-code run .claude/commands/complete-task.md TASK-001

# Get parallel tasks
claude-code run .claude/commands/parallel-tasks.md
```

## System Structure

### Files
- `master-tasks.json` - Complete task definitions (85 tasks)
- `task-queue.json` - Current queue and settings
- `task-status.json` - Task status tracking

### Commands
- `init-task-system.md` - Initialize the system (already run)
- `queue-status.md` - View comprehensive status
- `next-task.md` - Get next available task
- `complete-task.md` - Mark task as completed
- `parallel-tasks.md` - Get multiple parallel tasks
- `retry-task.md` - Retry failed tasks

## Current Status

**MVP Completion**: 75%
**Remaining Tasks**: 85
**Estimated Completion**: 6-8 weeks

### Critical Priorities
1. **Payment Integration** (PHASE-001) - Santander gateway
2. **Video Conversion UI** (PHASE-002) - Frontend completion  
3. **AI Health Features** (PHASE-003) - Gemini integration

### Active Phases
- PHASE-001: Critical Payment Integration (12 tasks)
- PHASE-002: Video Conversion UI (8 tasks)
- PHASE-003: AI Health Recommendations (10 tasks)

## Task Breakdown by Phase

### PHASE-001: Payment Integration (CRITICAL)
Essential for monetization. Includes Santander gateway integration, subscription management, and payment UI.

### PHASE-002: Video Conversion UI (HIGH)
Complete the frontend for the 80% finished video conversion system.

### PHASE-003: AI Health Recommendations (HIGH)
Integrate Gemini 2.0 for breed-specific health insights.

### PHASE-004: Performance & Security (MEDIUM)
Redis caching, rate limiting, security headers.

### PHASE-005: Testing & Documentation (MEDIUM)
Comprehensive testing and documentation.

### PHASE-006: Mobile Optimization (MEDIUM)
PWA features and mobile enhancements.

### PHASE-007: Admin Dashboard (LOW)
Analytics and management tools.

### PHASE-008: Affiliate System (LOW)
Enhance affiliate marketing integration.

### PHASE-009: Accessibility (MEDIUM)
WCAG 2.1 AA compliance improvements.

### PHASE-010: Final Polish (HIGH)
Launch preparation tasks.

### PHASE-011: Production Deployment (CRITICAL)
Azure infrastructure and deployment setup.

## Workflow Example

```bash
# 1. Check what's available
claude-code run .claude/commands/queue-status.md

# 2. Get a task
claude-code run .claude/commands/next-task.md

# 3. Implement the task...

# 4. Complete the task
claude-code run .claude/commands/complete-task.md TASK-001

# 5. Check for newly unblocked tasks
claude-code run .claude/commands/queue-status.md
```

## Parallel Execution

The system supports up to 3 parallel tasks. Use:
```bash
claude-code run .claude/commands/parallel-tasks.md
```

This will assign multiple independent tasks that can be worked on simultaneously.

## Dependencies

Tasks have dependencies that must be completed first. The system automatically:
- Tracks dependencies
- Blocks dependent tasks
- Queues tasks when dependencies are met
- Prevents circular dependencies

## Tips for Success

1. **Start with Payment Integration** - It's critical for MVP
2. **Work in Parallel** - Use parallel-tasks for efficiency
3. **Check Status Regularly** - Monitor progress and blockers
4. **Complete Full Tasks** - Ensure all files are created
5. **Test as You Go** - Include tests with implementations

## Support

For issues with the task system:
- Check task dependencies in master-tasks.json
- Verify queue state in task-queue.json
- Review task status in task-status.json
- Use retry-task.md for failed tasks
