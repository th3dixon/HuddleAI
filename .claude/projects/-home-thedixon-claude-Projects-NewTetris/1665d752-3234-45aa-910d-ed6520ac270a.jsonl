It's a new approach to calculation that uses principles of fundamental physics to solve extremely complex problems very quickly.\n\nMore specifically, quantum computing is a multidisciplinary field comprising aspects of computer science, physics, and mathematics that utilizes quantum mechanics to solve complex problems faster than classical computers. The field includes both hardware research and application development.\n\n## The Science Behind Quantum Computing\n\nQuantum computing uses the principles of quantum theory, which explains the behavior of energy and material on the atomic and subatomic levels. It employs subatomic particles, such as electrons or photons, as the basis for computation.\n\nQuantum mechanics is the area of physics that studies the behavior of particles at a microscopic level. At subatomic levels, the equations that describe how particles behave are different from those that describe the macroscopic world around us.\n\n## Quantum Bits (Qubits) vs. Classical Bits\n\nThe basic unit of information in quantum computing is the qubit (or \"quantum bit\"), which serves the same function as the bit in classical computing. However, there's a fundamental difference:\n\nWhile classical bits are binary and can hold only a position of 0 or 1, qubits can hold a superposition of all possible states. Quantum computers harness the unique behavior of quantum physics—such as superposition, entanglement, and quantum interference—and apply it to computing. This introduces new concepts to traditional programming methods.\n\nClassical computers process data using binary bits, which can be in one of two states — 0 or 1. The bits are encoded on transistors, which can be made from silicon, germanium or other semiconductors. Quantum computers use particles such as electrons or photons that behave as quantum bits, or qubits, which represent a superposition of both 0 and 1 — meaning they can exist in multiple states at once.\n\n## Key Quantum Properties\n\nThree key quantum properties make quantum computing powerful:\n\n1. **Superposition**:\n   Quantum bits, or qubits, allow particles to exist in more than one state (i.e., 1 and 0) at the same time. Superposition states that, much like waves in classical physics, you can add two or more quantum states and the result will be another valid quantum state. Conversely, you can also represent every quantum state as a sum of two or more other distinct states. This superposition of qubits gives quantum computers their inherent parallelism, allowing them to process millions of operations simultaneously.\n\n2. **Entanglement**:\n   Quantum entanglement occurs when two systems link so closely that knowledge about one gives you immediate knowledge about the other, no matter how far apart they are. Quantum processors can draw conclusions about one particle by measuring another one. For example, they can determine that if one qubit spins upward, the other will always spin downward, and vice versa. Quantum entanglement allows quantum computers to solve complex problems faster.\n\n3. **Quantum Interference**:\n   Quantum interference is the intrinsic behavior of a qubit, due to superposition, to influence the probability of it collapsing one way or another. Quantum computers are designed and built to reduce interference as much as possible and ensure the most accurate results.\n\n## Advantages Over Classical Computing\n\nTheoretically, linked qubits can \"exploit the interference between their wave-like quantum states to perform calculations that might otherwise take millions of years.\" \n\nA scalable quantum computer could perform some calculations exponentially faster than any modern \"classical\" computer. Theoretically a large-scale quantum computer could break some widely used encryption schemes and aid physicists in performing physical simulations.\n\nQuantum computing aims to use the unique behaviors of quantum physics to solve problems that are too complex for classical computing and to provide massive performance gains in existing high-end applications. To do so, specialized quantum computing hardware and algorithms take advantage of quantum properties. Quantum computers mark a potential leap forward in computing capability for certain applications. For example, quantum computing promises substantial advantages for tasks such as simulation, optimization and integer factorization.\n\n## Current State of Quantum Computing\n\nQuantum computers are not yet practical for real-world applications. Physically engineering high-quality qubits has proven to be challenging. If a physical qubit is not sufficiently isolated from its environment, it suffers from quantum decoherence, introducing noise into calculations.\n\nThe quantum computers available today are small, noisy prototypes, but the field is progressing rapidly. Quantum computers may soon become a critical part of the computing landscape as we move beyond cutting-edge Exascale computers.\n\nCurrently, no quantum computer can perform a useful task faster, cheaper, or more efficiently than a classical computer. Quantum advantage is the threshold where we have built a quantum system that can perform operations that the best possible classical computer cannot simulate in any kind of reasonable time.\n\n## Potential Applications\n\nQuantum computers are expected to excel in several areas:\n\nScientists and engineers anticipate that certain problems that are effectively impossible for conventional, classical computers to solve will be easy for quantum computers. Quantum computers are also expected to challenge current cryptography methods and to introduce new possibilities for completely private communication.\n\nSome applications where quantum computers can provide a speed boost include machine learning (ML), optimization, and simulation of physical systems. Eventual use cases could be portfolio optimization in finance or the simulation of chemical systems, solving problems that are currently impossible for even the most powerful supercomputers on the market.\n\nQuantum computing could contribute greatly to the fields of security, finance, military affairs and intelligence, drug design and discovery, aerospace designing, utilities (nuclear fusion), polymer design, machine learning, artificial intelligence (AI), Big Data search, and digital manufacturing.\n\n## Future Outlook\n\nThe current field of quantum computers isn't quite ready for prime time: McKinsey has estimated that 5,000 quantum computers will be operational by 2030 but that the hardware and software necessary for handling the most complex problems won't be available until 2035 or later. Yet organizations need to start thinking now about where they might leverage the technology to solve real-world business problems.\n\nMany researchers believe that quantum computers will complement rather than replace our conventional technologies. Progress in quantum computing continues, with ongoing development focused on advancing the advantages quantum computers are expected to have and how they may be helpful.\n\nIn summary, quantum computing represents a revolutionary approach to computation that harnesses quantum mechanical phenomena to potentially solve problems far beyond the capabilities of classical computers, though the technology is still in its early stages of development."}]},"uuid":"18801d52-ef92-428a-b2d1-2769700e7521","timestamp":"2025-05-20T13:10:07.196Z","toolUseResult":{"query":"What is quantum computing definition","results":["I'll perform a web search to find information about the definition of quantum computing.",{"tool_use_id":"srvtoolu_01VSPbC17omXujp14NrPmw53","content":[{"title":"Quantum Computing: Definition, How It's Used, and Example","url":"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/q/quantum-computing.asp"},{"title":"Quantum computing - Wikipedia","url":"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quantum_computing"},{"title":"Quantum computing: Facts about the ultra-powerful computers that use quantum mechanics | Live Science","url":"https://www.livescience.com/quantum-computing"},{"title":"What is Quantum Computing | Microsoft Azure","url":"https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/resources/cloud-computing-dictionary/what-is-quantum-computing"},{"title":"What is Quantum Computing?

Dogs were the first species to be domesticated by humans, over 14,000 years ago and before the development of agriculture.\n\nA dog is defined as \"a carnivorous mammal (Canis familiaris) closely related to the gray wolf that has long been domesticated as a pet, occurs in a variety of sizes, colors, and coat types, and is sometimes trained to perform special tasks (such as herding, guarding, or acting as a service animal).\"\n\nDogs belong to the dog family Canidae, having \"prominent canine teeth and, in the wild state, a long and slender muzzle, a deep-chested muscular body, a bushy tail, and large, erect ears.\"\n\nAny member of the family Canidae, including domestic dogs, wolves, coyotes, jackals, foxes, and their relatives (both living and extinct) can be considered canids. Interestingly, in 14th-century England, \"hound\" was the general word for all domestic canines, and \"dog\" referred to a subtype resembling the modern mastiff and bulldog. By the 16th century, \"dog\" had become the general word, while \"hound\" began to refer only to breeds used for hunting.\n\n## Physical Characteristics\n\nDog breeds vary widely in shape, size, and color. They have the same number of bones (with the exception of the tail), powerful jaws that house around 42 teeth, and well-developed senses of smell, hearing, and sight. Compared to humans, dogs possess a superior sense of smell and hearing, but inferior visual acuity.\n\nThe long association between dogs and humans has given rise to many dog breeds with different physical and behavioral characteristics. Each dog breed has its own unique characteristics that allow them to adapt to specific lifestyles and adoption needs.\n\nIn simple terms, a dog is \"an animal with fur, four legs, and a tail that is kept as a pet, or trained to guard buildings.\"\n\n## Behavioral Characteristics\n\nDogs perform many roles for humans, such as hunting, herding, pulling loads, protection, companionship, therapy, aiding disabled people, and assisting police and the military. Communication in dogs includes eye gaze, facial expression, vocalization, body posture (including movements of bodies and limbs), and gustatory communication (scents, pheromones, and taste).\n\nDogs mark their territories by urinating on them, which is more likely when entering a new environment. Over the millennia, dogs have uniquely adapted to human behavior; this adaptation includes being able to understand and communicate with humans. As such, the human-canine bond has been a topic of frequent study, and dogs' influence on human society has given them the sobriquet of \"man's best friend.\"\n\nBarking is a way for dogs to communicate with other dogs and with humans. Fierce barking or growling often signals that dogs are being territorial, feel threatened, or simply want to be left alone. However, dogs also bark when they are bored and want attention from other dogs or from humans.\n\nA dog may sniff other dogs' rear ends to gather chemical information that helps the sniffer identify them as individuals. Gland-lined sacs, housed internally on either side of a dog's anus, produce a scent that contributes to each dog's unique odor profile. That profile may also indicate genetic makeup, reproductive status, diet, and emotional state.\n\n## Domestication and Adaptation\n\nDue to their long association with humans, dogs have gained the ability to thrive on a starch-rich diet that would be inadequate for other canids. Dogs have been bred for desired behaviors, sensory capabilities, and physical attributes.\n\nThe characteristics of loyalty, friendship, protectiveness, and affection have earned dogs an important position in Western society, and in the United States and Europe the care and feeding of dogs has become a multibillion-dollar business.\n\n## Popular Breeds and Their Characteristics\n\nDifferent dog breeds have distinct traits and characteristics:\n\nThe Golden Retriever is one of the most popular dog breeds worldwide. It is known for its family-friendly nature, intelligent and docile character. Physical characteristics include being medium-sized, with golden plumage and a strong, athletic build. Character traits: Obedient, patient and friendly, especially ideal for families with children. Maintenance requires regular coat care and exercise, and they enjoy swimming and playing.\n\nThe Labrador Retriever was bred as a hunting dog and is still used today as a guide dog and search and rescue dog. Character traits include being intelligent, playful and energetic. They are easy to train and successful in various dog sports. Maintenance requires that the coat should be trimmed and combed regularly, and daily exercise and mental stimulation are important.\n\n## Global Population\n\nThe global dog population is estimated at 700 million to 1 billion, distributed around the world.\n\nDogs continue to be one of humanity's most beloved and versatile animal companions, with a rich history of domestication and adaptation that has allowed them to thrive alongside humans for thousands of years."}]},"uuid":"0429ad71-4e5e-40e6-9878-618e7abe3247","timestamp":"2025-05-20T13:10:49.242Z","toolUseResult":{"query":"What is a dog definition characteristics","results":["I'll perform a web search to find information about the definition and characteristics of dogs.",{"tool_use_id":"srvtoolu_013cf9m6t129PEVrnvnFMMiy","content":[{"title":"Dog - Wikipedia","url":"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dog"},{"title":"Dog | History, Domestication, Physical Traits, Breeds, & Facts | Britannica","url":"https://www.britannica.com/animal/dog"},{"title":"Dog Definition and Examples - Biology Online Dictionary","url":"https://www.biologyonline.com/dictionary/dog"},{"title":"DOG Definition & Meaning - Merriam-Webster","url":"https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/dog"},{"title":"Dog - Definition, Meaning & Synonyms | Vocabulary.com","url":"https://www.vocabulary.com/dictionary/dog"},{"title":"dog - Wiktionary, the free dictionary","url":"https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/dog"},{"title":"Dog Breeds: Different Breeds and Their Characteristics - Smyrna Pet","url":"https://smyrnapet.com/en/dog-breeds-different-breeds-and-their-characteristics/"},{"title":"DOG | definition in the Cambridge English Dictionary","url":"https://dictionary.cambridge.org/us/dictionary/english/dog"},{"title":"DOG | definition in the Cambridge Learner’s Dictionary","url":"https://dictionary.cambridge.org/us/dictionary/learner-english/dog"},{"title":"DOG Definition & Meaning | Dictionary.com","url":"https://www.dictionary.com/browse/dog"}]},"Based on the search results, I'll provide you with a comprehensive definition and characteristics of dogs.\n\n# Dog Definition and Characteristics\n\n## Definition\n\nA dog (Canis familiaris or Canis lupus familiaris) is a domesticated descendant of the gray wolf.
